README of lo-global-log project
====================================

lo-global-log subproject needs the LibreOffice
SDK in order to be built from scratch.

Since the LO SDK dependent part changes slowly, this subproject has
a prebuild for the objects needed as distribution item.

The structure is as follows.

src			the Java source directory, contains a simple class to return the version of the jar

idl			contains the UNOIDL (idl type file) descriptions of the new interfaces
			and related stuff (services, constants, enums...) declared for subsequent
			UNO packaging.

pre-built-type-classes
			contains the *.class files generated through the OOo SDK procedure, not under svn control

pre-built-type-rdb
			contains the type library to be used with the Java classes in
			pre-built-type-classes

The build process is divided into two parts:

1) the LO SDK part, where LO SDK is needed: use the target (project) prebuild in ant
to perform this step; e.g.: ant prebuild.

2) the standard part, where the jar library needed for the other subproject is built.
In order for the part 1) to succeeded you need an LO SDK installed and configured.
Then you need to change the platform specific file (e.g. build.Linux-i386.properties
in GNU/Linux platform) to suit your installation.
The file has comments that should enable you to understand the process.

The steps needed to add a new interface or a new UNO component are the followings:

1) describe the new element using UNO IDL language

2) compile the new definition with idlc from ooo_sdk

3) prepare the .rdb file containing the UNO registration information

4) use javamaker to generated the new class declaring the interface

5) using autodoc, generate the new UNO component html documentation

6) build a jar Java archive containing the .class file so generated
   this jar file is to be used as a referenced library in the subprojects
   that will use the new UNO interfaces.
   
7) when installing the extension install both file, the .rdb AND the .jar.

Step 1) is developer responsibility, using a text editor or Eclipse.

Steps 2) 3) and 4) 5) are carried out by the ant target 'prebuild', it generates
the documentation as well, using autodoc (as it's done in the OOo main build process),
and putting the documentation in the directory 'html-no-svn'.
The documentation is not (yet) under svn because of the automatic copyright note that
autodoc adds at the end of every file.

The main extension build has a specific target to build all what is needed.
The target is build-uno-jar-with-sdk, but the OOo SDK must be installed and able to compile the
IDL descriptions. 
This target will carry out the step 6) above.

The step 7) will be carried out by the main build implementation.

A good help in writing UNOIDL specification file could be the IDL editor embedded in
the Eclipse plug-in, the LOEclipse plugin can be installed directly from:
